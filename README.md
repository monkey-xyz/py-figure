# Web Scraper

A scraper for pulling entries from MFC. Includes name and link to the entry.

All comments for changing parameters are located in the file.

Running the scraper will create a JSON file in the same folder that contains a name, link, and the first image of the entry pulled. Saves a bit of time from having to go through each entry individually.

## How to
- Run the `scraper.py` file
